FIVE Individual PDF files per group
Note: L0X and GroupY are your class and group number, e.g., L01-GP-Group9 represents Group 9 in class L01.
Guidelines1. Each group is required to deliver a presentation (max. 20 mins excluding QA) in Week 12  13, and to submit a project report in Week 14 (max. eight A4 pages, font size 12 or above, excluding cover page and references. Citation in the text is required). In both the presentation and the report, you should concisely describe the following:a. find an existing application, product or service that is not intelligent and not good enough. Identify and discuss its deficiencies under different applicable scenarios.b. propose appropriate contemporary information technologies that you have learned from the COM1000 module and discuss how these technologies can be used to resolve those deficiencies for your chosen application, product or service in part (a).c. discuss any technical or functional limitations of your upgraded application, product or service in part (b), e.g, why would the application, product or service not-so-easy to be implemented or realized?d. discuss the impacts of your upgraded application, product or service on end users, e.g.,i. benefits (e.g., cost/time saving, improve customer satisfaction, etc.)ii. concerns (e.g., privacy, convenience, service quality and performance, etc.)Please note that we value quality (how good the report and analysis is) over quantity (how many pages or words you have written or how many slides you have).2. Each group is required to use IEEE Xplore digital library and gather detailed and current information on the topic of your project. During the project preparation, download FIVE PDF documents that are relevant to your topic and submit them to the Moodle together with your final report.Please refer to the appendix for the guidelines of downloading the journal articl代 写COM1000 Group Project (2024-25 Semester 1) Improving Existing Applications using Contemporary Information Technologies
代做程序编程语言es in IEEE Xplore digital library.
Example: The traditional class attendance system at HSUHK which allows teachers to take student attendance records manually.
ApplicationClass attendance system to record student attendance
Deficiencies
(1) it takes a long time to complete the attendance recording, particularly when the number of students in a class is large.(2) students may help the others to take attendance dishonestly.


Proposed contemporary information technologiesDeep learning (facial recognition) which recognizes the students’ face for taking attendance automatically
Limitation/performancePoor image quality or wearing masks could affect the performance of facial recognition
BenefitsTime and cost-saving, automation, etc.
ConcernsBreach of privacy, misidentification, etc.
Note● For the presentation, you may leverage different forms and media of presentation to convince the audience the superior value of your project. These forms and media may include (but not mandatory) slides, role-play, etc. Your group can decide how best you want to convey the essence of the project that you and your group members have completed.● Everyone must participate in the presentation and report writing.● For the report, good use of figures and illustrations, where appropriate, may help the readers to understand the contents.● Your topic MUST NOT be the same as your previous presentations.● Free riders may receive a lower or zero mark for the group project.
